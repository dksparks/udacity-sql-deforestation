  The question as written does not make sense.
  Quartiles, by definition, will always either contain
  the same number of items or differ by at most 1
  if the number of items in the data set is not
  divisible by 4.

  Instead, I am speculating that the question wants me
  to create four groups of countries by percent 
  forestation with break points at 25%, 50%, and 75%.
  These are NOT quartiles, but at least such a
  classification is a sensible thing to do.
